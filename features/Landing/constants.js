  headline: `Zircat: The Web Development Consultancy of your Dreams`,
  mainPitch: ` With over a decade of experience working on dozens of projects at
    every imaginable size and budget, we've learned a few things along
    the way, and we love being able to share that unique expertise. From
    enterprises like Vodafone, Origin and Bupa, to agencies like Next
    Digital and DT, to various start-ups, and even the NSW Department of
    Justice, our specialists have made careers with proven track records
    of success at every scale. They've done rapid-feedback prototyping
    in tandem with UI and UX designers; built campaigns and highly
    animated websites for brands like Honda, Ford and Bonds; built large
    and sophisticated web applications; built custom tools, libraries
    and frameworks to make developers lives easier; managed teams of
    developers large and small, built out development teams large and
    small, mentored and upskilled developers at all levels, and even
    personally lead entire digital transformations of enterprise
    organisations; and in everything we do, we pursue with determination
    the very best possible outcomes.`,
  specialPitch: `So you need an in-house software team, but you don't know where to
    start, who to hire, or what it needs to be set up for success.
    You've thought about bringing in a big-name consultancy, but they
    only "loan" people to you for a short time. You need your own
    people, your own team, your own expertise, under your own
    organisation. That's where we come in. Zircat specialises in
    building out world-class software teams for organisations of all
    kinds. We can work with you to determine what roles to hire, what
    structures and processes should be put in place, and develop a
    step-by-step roadmap showing the way. What about implementing that
    roadmap? Luckily, you can leave all that to us! We'll take care of
    hiring the right people (under your own organisation), training and
    upskilling on engineering best practices, and embedding the most
    appropriate agile methodology suited to the needs of your business.
    We will then give you regular progress updates so that you're always
    in the loop, and you will have oversight over the entire journey.
    Wanna know the best bit? When we're all done, you get to keep
    everything! Your team, your expertise, your personnel are all part
    of your organisation. Only our small team of Zircat specialists will
    move on, leaving you with a world-class engineering team all of your
    own, customised and designed around your business needs.`,
